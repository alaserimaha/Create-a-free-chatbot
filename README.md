# Create a free chatbot

What if we want to add a chatbot to our website to clarify some points for the user, to receive his questions and to communicate with him!

There are many types of chatbots, some for websites and some for applications such as Whatâ€™s up and so on.
There are also types to use, such as:
- BASIC FAQ chatbot:
Answer commonly-asked questions with this simple FAQ bot.

- CONVERSATIONAL RESUME chat bot:
Make your resume stand out from the crowd. Share your work experience through a friendly chatbot.

- ADVANCED FAQ Chatbot :
An interactive FAQ bot that answers commonly-asked questions. Works best when you have a lot of content that needs to be categorized!

Let's say we want to add a simple chatbot to [the robot motion control site](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Control-the-robot-using-the-buttons) that we created earlier

There are several platforms through which we can create a chatbot.
We will create our own chatbot using the [landbot](https://landbot.io/) platform

The platform offers a free trial, and it also offers many types of chatbots, and it's great for beginners and professionals as well.
