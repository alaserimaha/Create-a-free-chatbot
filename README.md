# Create a free chatbot

What if we want to add a chatbot to our website to clarify some points for the user, to receive his questions and to communicate with him!

There are many types of chatbots, some for websites and some for applications such as What’s up and so on.
There are also types to use, such as:
- BASIC FAQ chatbot:
Answer commonly-asked questions with this simple FAQ bot.

- CONVERSATIONAL RESUME chat bot:
Make your resume stand out from the crowd. Share your work experience through a friendly chatbot.

- ADVANCED FAQ Chatbot :
An interactive FAQ bot that answers commonly-asked questions. Works best when you have a lot of content that needs to be categorized!

Let's say we want to add a simple chatbot to [the robot motion control site](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Control-the-robot-using-the-buttons) that we created earlier

There are several platforms through which we can create a chatbot.
We will create our own chatbot using the [landbot](https://landbot.io/) platform

The platform offers a free trial, and it also offers many types of chatbots, and it's great for beginners and professionals as well.

Let's start designing our own chatbot
We will choose a BASIC FAQ chatbot whose idea is to answer user questions
We will simplify the idea as the chatbot will ask a set of questions to the user, and the user chooses the question he wants to ask
Then the robot will answer that question.

After the selection, we will start with the first stage:
## billd

We're going to create a template which is the quickest way to setup a FAQ bot with minimal content.
The template contains all the scenarios that may be presented to the user, and all the questions and answers that will appear to the user, as well as navigation for them.

Let's say our chatbot is named (الروبوت مها) The robot will greet first and then present three possible questions
When the user chooses one of these questions, the answer to the question will appear .

The fourth and most important stage is :
## adding a chatbot to our web page.
All we will do:
1. Choose how do you want your landbot to display.
2. Copy and paste [the script code](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Create-a-free-chatbot/blob/main/EMBED%20INTO%20WEBSITE.js) anywhere in the <body> section of your website
