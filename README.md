What if we want to add a chatbot to our website to clarify some points for the user, to receive his questions and to communicate with him!

There are many types of chatbots, some for websites and some for applications such as Whatâ€™s up and so on.
There are also types to use, such as:
- BASIC FAQ chatbot:

- CONVERSATIONAL RESUME chat bot:
Make your resume stand out from the crowd. Share your work experience through a friendly chatbot.

- ADVANCED FAQ Chatbot :
